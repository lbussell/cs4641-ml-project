    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In baseball, there are a few distinct types of pitches that a pitcher can make, and it is tough to tell which one
        they will make at any given time. However, a pitcher isn’t a random number generator - they likely make certain
        pitches with higher probability than others, and change up their strategy depending on the state of the game and
        the opposing batter’s skill. Knowing what pitch that an opposing pitcher is going to make next can help to
        improve a batter’s accuracy.</p>

    <p>The inspiration for this project came from discussion with a manager on Georgia Tech’s baseball team, who
        envisioned a system that could predict their opponent’s pitches without cheating.</p>

    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>Hitting a baseball is very difficult. A great batter can hit the ball only about 30% of the time. We would like
        to increase the chances of a Major League Baseball batter hitting the ball by predicting for them ahead of time
        what kind of pitch (fast ball, curve ball, etc) will be thrown next. This will be based on several factors: for
        example, if all bases are loaded and the incoming batter has very strong stats, then the pitcher is likely to
        walk the batter. As such, we will include the stats of the batter (average hit rate, percent of home runs,
        etc.), the number of runs, the state of the bases, and the pitcher’s previous throws as features in our model.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>Train a machine learning model based on a pitcher’s prior games, taking in the game’s state, the pitcher’s
        metrics, and each batter’s metrics. Then in the middle of a game, use this model to try and predict the
        pitcher’s next move so that the batter can anticipate the pitch and has a better chance at hitting the ball.
        Some possible machine learning techniques for this task include using random forest, as seen in some previous
        research in this area. On the deep learning side, given that we’re dealing with data that changes over time,
        using a recurrent neural network such as a Long Short Term Memory may also be effective.</p>

    <h2>Potential Results</h2>
    <p>We would like to be able to predict the pitcher’s next move with a reliability greater than the naive guess.
        Ideally, this would be applicable to a real baseball game, allowing a batter to have a higher likelihood of
        hitting the ball. This can be tested on previous (and future) major league baseball games, by picking a subset
        of them that will not be used in training our model and comparing how our predictions are in comparison to the
        real pitches in the game. While it is unlikely that our predictions will be extremely accurate, we would like to
        predict at a statistically significant rate higher than a naive guess, as this would constitute an improvement.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>At this stage, there are still some components about the implementation that aren’t yet defined, such as which
        specific features to use, and whether to predict simply the type of pitch or also the speed. Additionally, it is
        hard to determine how viable the idea is. For example, some studies show a significant improvement compared to
        the naive guess, while others show none.</p>
